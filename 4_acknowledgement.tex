\centerline{{\bf \Large Acknowledgments}} \vspace{5mm} \noindent

First of all, I would like to thank Prof. L. Jeff HONG, my advisor during my MPhil study. He has impacted me by showing the following facts through his words and deeds. Firstly, research could be so interesting. Secondly, a successful researcher, like him, could enjoy an academic life so much. Thirdly and most importantly, people with properties of successful researchers, like him, could have a much deeper understanding of the world we're living in.

After that, I would like to thank Dr. J. LUO, a senior lab-mate of mine. He led me to office from Choi Hung MTR station the first time I came to UST. He also led this research and got paper published on Operation Research.

Then, I would like to thank our department for supporting me with the studentship and an academic atmosphere here.

Finally, I would like to give my best wishes to all the people I meet here. Thank you for sharing this period of life with me.

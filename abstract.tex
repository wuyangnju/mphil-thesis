Conventional simulation ranking-and-selection(R\&S) procedures are designed and implemented in serial computing environment. However, it is the trend that the growth of computing power relies more on parallelism rather than faster serial execution. The consequence is that it becomes more and more difficult for those serial simulation R\&S procedures to take advantage of the development of computing technology. In this thesis, we propose our design and implementation of simulation R\&S procedures in parallel computing environment with master-slave structure in higher level. Extensive numerical experiments show that our parallel simulation R\&S procedures is capable of large-scale problems with scalability against the number of available parallel computing units.
